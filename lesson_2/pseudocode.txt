example Casual Pseudocode
# a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that 
is all those strings concatenated together

Given an array of strings
Set an empty placeholder string that will be added to as we iterate through the array
Iterate through the array performing the following on each loop
  - read the element
  - add it to the empty string
After iterating through, return the placeholder string that now has each
array string element added to it.

example Formal Pseudocode
START

# a function that takes an array of integers, 
and returns a new array with every other element

//Input & Output 
GET array of integers; arrayIntegers
SET empty array; outputArray

// Looping through arrayIntegers
SET iterator = 0
WHILE iterator <= length of arrayIntegers
INCREMENT iterator 2 so as to skip every other element
PUSH element at each iterator index of arrayIntegers into outputArray

RETURN outputArray
